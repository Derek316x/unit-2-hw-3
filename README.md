# Todo Core Data

The project file for this weeks homework has some starter code. Specifically, there is an established `NSManagedObjectModel` (MarsWater.xcdatamodeld) and classes for each respective `Entity`.
The code in place successfully creates and saves `List` objects.

The minimum requirement for your assignment is to create the functionality that supports creating `Task` objects, adding `Task` objects to a list, and saving the list.
You can determine the UX to make this happen, but it should be apparent that the tasks have been saved to the list.

**Bonus options:**  
* Allow users to edit a List/Task  
* Allow users to delete a List/Task
